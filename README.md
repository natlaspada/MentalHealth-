Associations between Demographic Variables and Mental Health 
The source of data was the MEPS HC-181 data set, which is an open source data set utilizing survey data taken over two year panels. The research question investigated if there are associations between certain demographic variables (education, employment status, income, and poverty category) and perceived mental health status. The variables were categorical so chi-squared tests were used for data analysis.
